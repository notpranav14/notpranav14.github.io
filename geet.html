        “Since handwritten letters aren’t an option right now, let this digital letter carry my thoughts to you instead. 

I’m writing to ask something that’s been on my heart: **Would you do me the honor of being mine?** I may not be perfect, but I promise to help and support you at every point.
          I would first like to thank you for being you. The way you think the way you do things I'm so in love. And secondly I would also like to thank you for helping me out every single time. My go-to person for all sorts of rant. I never felt the way i do for you geet, you always appreciate me support me thats more than enough I could've ever asked for.Tho, im still unsure if you think the same for me if so, if you maybe wanna reject this then its absolutely okay geet ;)”</p>
